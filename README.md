# **Python Basics Crash Course**

## **About the Project**
This repository is designed as a step-by-step Python crash course tailored for beginners with no prior experience in Python. It covers the fundamental concepts typically taught in a university-level **Python 101** class, with hands-on examples and detailed explanations. Whether you're learning Python for the first time or refreshing your skills, this course provides a solid foundation for scripting and programming in Python.

## **What's Included**
The repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts organized by topics and lessons. Each file is focused on a specific concept or a combination of topics to provide a gradual learning curve.

### **Key Topics Covered**
- **Day 1 - Day 7:** Introduction to Python, variables, data types, and basic syntax.
- **Day 8 - Day 15:** Control structures (loops, conditionals), working with strings, and functions.
- **Day 16 - Day 22:** Advanced data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- **Day 23 - Day 29:** Practical applications: file handling, loops with conditions, slicing, sorting, and number counting.
- **Special Lessons:** 
  - Range and for-loops
  - Turtle graphics
  - Conditional logic combined with loops

Each file is named descriptively (e.g., `Python(day21).ipynb`, `Python_day19_ifstatements.ipynb`) to make it easy to navigate and locate topics.
